## Topic: *Does a student's caffeine intake affect their overall productivity?*
#### Members: Rovin Soriano, Ian Lopez, Tri Tran, Godfrey Lozada, Howie Nguyen


### Introduction:
<p>For this project, we polled students with questions regarding caffeine consumption and their overall productiveness.
    "Overall Productiveness" includes factors such as: </p>
    
- Time spent studying/finishing class assignments
- Participation in Extracurricular Activities (Clubs, Hobbies, Etc)
- Sleeping Habits

<p>Meanwhile regarding caffiene consumption habits, we will analyze factors such as:</p>

- Amount of caffiene consumed
- Preffered caffienated beverage
- Typical time of caffiene consumption
- Reasons to drink caffiene

<p>Using these datapoints, we would like to know how/if a person's caffeine consumption habits would affect thier overall productiveness as a student. Or, in other words, we would like to know if their is a correlation between caffiene consumption and overall productiveness.
